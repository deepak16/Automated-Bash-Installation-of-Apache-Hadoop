Steps for automatic hadoop installation , configuration and testing are :

1.>  Enable the superuser mode when running scripts
2.>  Run install_hadoop.sh first
3.>  Run hadoop_configuration.sh 
4.>  Provide your java home path on the terminal (typically it is : "/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-i386")
5.>  For understanding the details of the configuring script , you may refer to  "hadoop_configuration_details.txt"
6.>  Finally run test_hadoop.sh to see if hadoop is working or node , i.e if the clusters have formed or not.

Note : If you have done any partial implementation of hadoop before , then please undo those changes and set things to default before running the scripts.
